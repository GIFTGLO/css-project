    <h1 style="color:blueviolet;">lions</h1>
    <h2 id="demo">Lions do most of their hunting at night as their eyes have adapted to the dark and this gives them a huge advantage over
    their prey. Interestingly though, lions also hunt during storms. The noise, rain and/or wind make it harder for prey to
    see and hear them, increasing their chances of a successful hunt. When hunting, lionesses have specific roles. Some play
    the role of 'centre' and others the role of 'wing' - the wings chase the prey towards the centres.</h2><br>

    <h3>There are thought to be as few as 23,000 lions left in the wild. When you think there are around 415,000 wild African
    elephants, you realise lion numbers are incredibly low.
    In fact, lions have disappeared from over 90% of their historical range.</h3>
